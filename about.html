      <div class="txtCont"><p class="aboutTxt">"Hi, my name is Lauren Cowell. I am the founder of Siblings Helping Other Siblings and the luckiest twin sister in the world! My brother Aidan is on the Autism Spectrum and never seizes to amaze me on a daily basis. He has taught me what hard work looks like and to push boundaries even when seemingly impossible. I can easily say that I would not be the person I am today without having Aidan as my brother. Although I value every opportunity and experience that I have had from having a sibling with special needs, and love my brother more than anything in the world, I would be lying if I said that I haven't struggled throughout my life with supporting him, and myself. It wasn't until recently that I became okay with talking to a professional about challenges that I have encountered and problems that I need help resolving. Although the support community is continuously growing with <!--<a href="resources.html#goToSib">programs</a>-->programs, there is still a lack of support for teenagers and young adults. I got the idea to create a safe, online support community where people can anonymously ask questions, share experiences, and get help through other members and myself. I hope that this website allows you to gain support and if there are any problems or inquiries please reach out to me."</p>

      <div class="txtCont"><p class="aboutTxt">"Being autistic is something that has given me a unique view on life much more for the better than the worse. It has given me more assets that have benefited me in the long run. I also have many ambitions in life including reading, fiction writing, and gymnastics, along with many others. The fact that this website is about supporting people like my sister is very enlightening. I support her fully with her goals on this website. I am very proud to have her as a sister!" - Aidan Cowell</p>
